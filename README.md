# python-cayley
A python library to easily connect and run Gremlin queries on Cayley. Inspired by the work made on pyley 
and by the coding style of Django.

## DISCLAIMER
This library is still a WIP:
* need a setup,
* need testing code,
* need better documentation
...but feel free to try it out.

## Basic Usage
`from cayley import g`
and use the g object to run query against your local Cayley instance as you could do on the http instance
